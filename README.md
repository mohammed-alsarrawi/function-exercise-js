# JavaScript Practice Problems

This document outlines a series of JavaScript problems designed to improve your programming skills. Each problem includes a description and expected output.

---

## Q1: Reverse a Number
Write a JavaScript function that reverses a given number.

**Example Input**:  
`x = 532443`

**Expected Output**:  
`344235`

---

## Q2: Odd or Even Checker
Write a loop that iterates from 0 to 15. For each iteration, the program should check if the current number is odd or even and log the result to the console.

**Example Output**:


---

## Q3: Alphabetical Order
Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string with its letters arranged in alphabetical order.

**Example Input**:  
`"Orange"`

**Expected Output**:  
`"aegnor"`

*Note*: Assume no punctuation or numeric symbols are included in the input string.

## Q4: Insert Dashes Between Even Numbers

**Example Input**:  
`025468`

**Expected Output**:  
`"0-254-6-8"`

## Q5: Age Checker
Write a function called `AgeChecker` that takes a user's age as input and checks if the user is an adult or a minor.

**Expected Output**:  
- If the age is 18 or more: `"The user is Adult"`
- Otherwise: `"The user is Minor"`
